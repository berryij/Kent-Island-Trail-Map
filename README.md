# Kent-Island-Trail-Map
This map is a class project for Dr. Sugg's Web Mapping Course. In this assignment, we made a trail map with different functions. The map I created is located in Kent Island, Maryland, and highlights key features of the Cross Island Trail (Kent Island Trail). The world map used was ESRI World Topo Map, and data was collected via Google Maps and converted to geojson files using mapbox and maps to gpx. This map uses custom path parameters to highlight the trail on the map. The map also includes a custom description and title. The description helps the user get a summary of the trail itself and understand a few points of interest. A link is also provided if the user wants to investigate further into the trail and its history. This map is a good example of how to make a web map and how to edit features to make a visually appealing map.
